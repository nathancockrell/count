# TO DO
So this app is kind of like a clicker game
- The main thing that's different is that some of the clickers represent things in real life
- but there should be achievements
- and streaks
- and therefore score and levels
### Reward
- the game should not reward amount of time spent on the app
- it should reward consistency with the app
- and it should reward doing things in real life that you want to do
- there can be other rewards to supplement these
